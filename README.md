# InterFace-Code
The following repository stores the Processing Code utilized for the public installation Inter(Face). 
The Arduino Code utilized to accomplish Processing-Arduino communication was the StandardFirmata script from the Firmata library within Arduino.
The Processing Code functions off of the use of PGraphics objects as layers, jumping to the next "layer" when a certain command is engaged to leave the lower layers unaffected by future manipulations.
Further explanation of the code can be found in the comments of the Processing script file.

NOTE: THIS SOFTWARE MAY NOT BE REPORDUCED, DISTRIBUTED, OR USED IN DERIVATIVE FORMS OF INTER(FACE).
